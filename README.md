# Twitter Clone Application

Twitter has become as much of a social phenomenon as a way of life in the digital era. This app allows users to concisely put forth an opinion or share news.  Hence, we were interested in replicating the functionality of this application to suit our needs. This application will allow users to interact with each other through tweets and facilitate real world interactivity through easy updating and viewing. 

## Description

The application will be able to perform the following tasks: -
•	Registration and Login of any number of users.
•	Following and unfollowing users.
•	Sending tweets about any content user desires.
•	Allowing user to view his personal Twitter feed.
